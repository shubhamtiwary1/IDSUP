i. all() and any():

all(iterable) returns True if all elements of the iterable are true (or if the iterable is empty). It returns False if any element is false.
any(iterable) returns True if at least one element of the iterable is true. It returns False if all elements are false or if the iterable is empty.

ii. str() and repr() function:

str() returns a human-readable representation of an object. It's meant to be easily readable by humans and is used for displaying information to users.
repr() returns an unambiguous representation of an object. It's used for debugging and logging and is meant to be more detailed and unambiguous than str().

iii. sort() and sorted():

sort() is a method that sorts the elements of a list in place (modifies the original list).
sorted() is a built-in function that returns a new sorted list from the elements of any iterable (does not modify the original iterable).

iv. random.choice() and random.sample():

random.choice() is a function that returns a random element from a non-empty sequence.
random.sample() is a function that returns a list of unique elements chosen randomly from a population sequence without replacement. The number of elements returned is specified by the k argument.
